summary: 'Students participating in ManyClasses 1 need to be given the option to provide informed consent, but ideally instructors should not know which students have consented to participate. We created a tool to enable encrypted consent.'

All students enrolled in a ManyClasses class will experience all experimental treatments, because all experimental treatments are normal classroom practices assigned by the instructor to all students.  However, students will nevertheless be able to choose whether they permit their coursework and grades to be analyzed by the researchers for the first ManyClasses study ([ManyClasses 1](../projects/many-classes-1/)).  Future ManyClasses studies may have sufficient safeguards in place (e.g., automated treatment assignment, secure transfer of de-identified passively-collected research data, etc.) to mitigate the need for affirmative consent, but for now, students will be invited to provide their consent to become research participants before their coursework is included in ManyClasses 1.

The need to collect informed consent presents a challenge in real classrooms.  While the researchers need to know who has agreed to participate (in order to include the right students), the teacher, in principle, should _not_ know who has consented.  If the teacher knows who has consented, it introduces the possibility of inappropriate coercion (the power differential between teacher and student should not be a factor in whether a student chooses to consent).

**The challenge is: How to obtain informed consent in a course site, where the researchers can tell who consented, while preventing the instructor from knowing who consented?**

We call our solution: *Encrypted consent*

In the future, we may develop research safeguards that would render it unnecessary to require students to provide affirmative consent for automatically de-identified data to be included in a ManyClasses study.  In such a situation, this encrypted consent tool might still be used to provide a secure *opt-out* mechanism, where students are given the opportunity to exclude themselves from the research study without the instructor's awareness.
