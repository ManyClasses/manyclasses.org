The Stage 1 (data-blind) manuscript for the first ManyClasses study has been granted an "in-principle acceptance" from the journal [Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/ampps)!

The frozen, time-stamped preregistered project is here: https://osf.io/sdqwm, which contains:
* The Stage 1 approved manuscript: https://osf.io/h7d9t/
* The code that implements our analysis plan from simulated data: https://osf.io/pkn68/
* and guides for instructors, IRB protocol documents, and more...

Participating teachers will be added as authors when the Stage 2 manuscript is submitted after data collection.

ManyThanks to all!
