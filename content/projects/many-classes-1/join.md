## What is ManyClasses?

ManyClasses is a collaborative research project investigating the generalizability of educational interventions across a variety of authentic college classes. Rather than conducting an embedded learning study in just one class, ManyClasses will examine the same research question in dozens of contexts. Learn more at https://manyclasses.org. 

## What is the purpose of this ManyClasses 1 study?

The purpose of this first ManyClasses study (ManyClasses 1) is to examine how the timing of feedback affects student learning in authentic college courses over the course of a single semester (Fall 2019). 

Specifically, we will compare the effects of immediate feedback (i.e., feedback provided right after an assignment is submitted) versus delayed feedback (i.e., feedback provided several days after an assignment is submitted) on student learning outcomes. Additionally, given the fact that students automatically see immediate feedback but not delayed feedback, another factor we will examine is whether students are incentivized to view the feedback provided.

We selected to investigate the timing of feedback in the first ManyClasses experiment for several reasons:

* The provision of feedback is highly recommended for improving student learning
* The provision of feedback is a common component of most classes and will not represent a deviation from normal practice
* Instructors must decide when to provide feedback to their students and they need evidence-based recommendations to inform that decision
* There are recent claims that delayed feedback is more effective than immediate feedback, which contrasts with current recommendations to educators to provide feedback immediately after student work is submitted

## Who is eligible to apply?

College instructors who are teaching an undergraduate course in the Fall 2019 semester that:

* Uses Canvas as the online learning management system
* Includes at least four objectively-graded assignments on four different topics administered via Canvas
* Includes a measure of student learning that is administered after the assignments, where separate student outcomes (e.g., sets of exam items, etc.) can be independently mapped on each of the four assignments
* Has a projected enrollment of at least 30 undergraduate students

We are interested to include a wide range of different classes, topics, formats, disciplines, and student populations. Thus, we encourage applications from many different types of instructors who teach many different types of classes. Participating instructors do not need prior research experience nor familiarity with educational research to apply.

## What is expected of selected instructors?

The primary responsibility of the selected instructor is to facilitate the recruitment of students for ManyClasses 1 by announcing the research opportunity to one course that meets the eligibility requirements. Prior to or during the Fall 2019 semester, instructors will also be asked to:

* Add an approved researcher to their Canvas course who will facilitate the implementation of the feedback conditions on selected assignments
* Include an approved statement on the course syllabus that informs the students that there will be minor variations in course materials
* Provide the research team with the course assignments that can be objectively scored
* Provide the research team with the course assessments (e.g., exams) and a mapping of which assessment items correspond to knowledge/skills on any given assignment
* Determine the worth (e.g., class points, extra credit, etc) of the follow-up assignments that require students to view the provided feedback 

## What are the potential benefits for selected instructors?

There are at least three potential benefits for college instructors who apply and are selected to be involved in the first ManyClasses research project:

* Participation in an ambitious research project that seeks to bring researchers and educators together to better understand the generalizability of educational interventions across a variety of authentic college classes
* Access to direct empirical findings on the effects of immediate versus delayed feedback on course assignments in the instructor’s class
* Authorship on subsequent publication of the findings of ManyClasses 1

## What is expected of students in participating classes?

Across the semester, all students will engage with assigned course materials as they normally would. No student will receive any exercise or intervention beyond the objectively-scored assignments and outcome assessments, both of which are common practices in the normal conduct of college courses. 

On any given assignment, there will be slight variations in the timing of the feedback and in the requirement to view that feedback. However, all students will be exposed to all variations. For example, a student may receive immediate feedback that is required to be viewed on the first assignment and delayed feedback that is not required to be viewed on the second assignment.

At the beginning of the semester, students will be informed of the opportunity for their coursework to be included in this research project. Prior to completing the first assignment, they will complete a consent form and a FERPA waiver, which allows them to opt-in or opt-out of the study. For students who opt-in, their data from the course will be shared with the research team. For students who opt-out, they will engage in the same course activities, but their data from the course will not be shared with the research team.

## Who is running this project?

The ManyClasses team is:

* Paulo Carvalho (Carnegie Mellon University)
* Josh de Leeuw (Vassar College)
* Emily Fyfe (Indiana University)
* Rob Goldstone (Indiana University)
* Ben Motz (Indiana University)

This research study is being managed by research personnel from Indiana University and it has been approved by the IRB (Protocol #XXXXXXXXXX).
