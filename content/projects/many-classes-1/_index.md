## ManyClasses1 Background

The goal of ManyClasses 1 was to examine how the timing of feedback affects student learning in authentic college courses over the course of a single semester. Specifically, we compared the effects of immediate feedback (i.e. feedback provided right after an assignment is submitted) versus delayed feedback (i.e. feedback provided several days after an assignment is submitted) on course-relevant student learning outcomes. Additionally, given the fact that students automatically see immediate feedback but not delayed feedback, another factor we examined is whether students were incentivized to view the feedback provided.  The study, analysis plan, and manuscript was [publicly registered](https://osf.io/sdqwm) prior to data collection.

We chose to investigate the timing of feedback in ManyClasses 1 for several reasons:

1. The provision of feedback on course assignments is highly recommended for improving student learning (e.g., American Psychological Association, Coalition for Psychology in Schools and Education, 2015; Benassi, Overson, & Hakala, 2014; Booth, McGinn, Barbieri, Begolli, Chang, Miller-Cotto, Young, & Davenport, 2017; Pashler et al., 2007),  
2. The provision of feedback is a common component of most classes and will not represent a deviation from normal practice,
3. Instructors must decide when to provide feedback to their students and they need evidence-based recommendations to inform that decision, and
4. There are recent claims that delayed feedback is more effective than immediate feedback (see Butler & Woodward, 2018), which contrasts with current recommendations to educators to provide feedback immediately.

Our goal was to have approximately 40 instructors apply to have their students participate representing a wide range of different classes, topics, formats, disciplines, and student populations. College instructors teaching undergraduate courses at participating institutions during Fall 2019 were invited to apply if they met the following criteria: uses Canvas as the course's online learning management system, includes at least two assignments on different topics that can be administered on Canvas and can be objectively scored, includes a measure of student learning that is administered after the assignments and targets content from the assignments, and has a projected enrollment of at least 30 undergraduate students.  All instructors who applied and who met these criteria were invited to participate, and no participating instructors withdrew during the study.
