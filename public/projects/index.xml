      <description>We will focus on a specific instructional practice: the provision of immediate feedback on student assignments. We opted to focus on immediate feedback for several reasons: (1) it is highly recommended for improving student learning in STEM fields (Pashler et al., 2007), (2) it is a common component of most classes and will not represent a deviation from normal practice, (3) instructors must decide (implicitly or explicitly) when to provide feedback to their students and they need evidence-based recommendations to inform that decision, and (4) there are controversial claims that delayed feedback is better than immediate feedback, which directly contrasts with current recommendations to educators (see Butler &amp;amp; Woodward, 2018).</description>
