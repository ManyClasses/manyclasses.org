    <div class="article-content">
      <p>We will focus on a specific instructional practice: the provision of immediate feedback on student assignments. We
opted to focus on immediate feedback for several reasons: (1) it is highly recommended for improving student
learning in STEM fields (Pashler et al., 2007), (2) it is a common component of most classes and will not
represent a deviation from normal practice, (3) instructors must decide (implicitly or explicitly) when to provide
feedback to their students and they need evidence-based recommendations to inform that decision, and (4)
there are controversial claims that delayed feedback is better than immediate feedback, which directly contrasts
with current recommendations to educators (see Butler &amp; Woodward, 2018).</p>

<p>Target participants for this study will include college students from approximately 40 different college courses
whose instructors volunteered to participate. Instructors will be recruited from a range of institutions that are
members of the Unizin Consortium and use Canvas as their online learning system (e.g., University of Michigan,
University of Wisconsin, etc.), but the research will be entirely managed and administered locally at Indiana
University. Students and their instructors will participate within their regularly instructed course for a full
semester. Throughout the semester, students will complete three experimental assignments that are
administered on the computer via Canvas. Assignments will be randomly assigned to receive trial-by-trial
delayed feedback (several days after the assignment is complete). Thus, some students might receive trial-by-
trial feedback on the first assignment, immediate feedback on the second assignment, and delayed feedback on
the third. However, for other students, it might be the opposite. We opted to use a within-subjects design so
that all students are exposed to all three feedback conditions. Students will also complete a posttest assessment
(e.g., final exam) that in some way assesses the content knowledge from each assignment. The type and timing
of the posttest assessment will vary by class and will reflect natural variation in instructor preferences, but the
scores will be tied to specific students so we can examine condition differences on learning.</p>

<p>Prior to the fall semester, instructors will participate in a one-day training hosted at Indiana University.
Researchers will explain the general procedure of the study and will show the instructors a mock class in Canvas.
Instructors will then engage in a hands-on design session, in which they will create assignments in Canvas with
the help of the researchers. Between the training day and the first day of classes, a member of the research
team will provide direct guidance to each instructor to ensure that the assignments meet the necessary criteria
and to program in the different feedback conditions. The intended timeline for this initial ManyClasses study is
to recruit instructors in spring 2019, conduct the one-day training for participating instructors in late summer
2019, and begin data collection at the start of the semester in fall 2019.</p>
